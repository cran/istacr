# Indicators: Systems

## Get indicators systems
This function returns a list of indicator systems published in the ISTAC-indicators database. The indicators are simple or compound statistics, however a single indicator can rarely provide useful information about complex phenomena such as the economic situation, living conditions, schooling or others. Indicator systems are generally designed to generate more and more accurate information about the conditions of a phenomenon; and for this they are organized in dimensions or areas of analysis, under which the indicators are integrated.

### Parameters
- limit (int): Results limit. By default ``limit = 25``.
- offset (int): Displacement. Result from which it is returned. By default ``offset = 0``.

### Examples
```{code}
get_indicators_systems()
```

## Get indicators system code
This function returns metadata of a system of indicators published in the ISTAC-indicators database. The indicators are simple or compound statistics, however a single indicator can rarely provide useful information about complex phenomena such as the economic situation, living conditions, schooling or others.

### Parameters
- indicatorsystemcode (string): an indicator system code

### Examples
```{code}
get_indicators_systems_code("C00075H")
```

## Get indicators system code instances
This function returns instances of indicators associated with a specific indicator system. An instance of an indicator is nothing more than a spatio-temporal query of an indicator when it is incorporated into a specific indicator system.

### Parameters
- indicatorsystemcode (string): with an indicator system code
- q (string): Query of metadata on which the searches can be built are: ``id`` and ``geographicalValue``.
- order (string): Order. Possible values are: ``update`` and ``id`` and order criteria are ``ASC`` and ``DESC``.
- limit (int): Results limit. By default ``limit = 25``.
- offset (int): Displacement. Result from which it is returned.  By default ``offset = 0``.
- fields (string): Use of the answer by adding new fields. Possible values are: ``+metadata``, ``+data`` and ``+observationsMetadata``.
- representation (string): Allows filtering the observations by their value. Its use only makes sense when ``+data`` and/or ``+observationsMetadata`` has been included.
- granularity (string): Allows to filter the observations through the granularities of the same. Its use only makes sense when ``+data`` and/or ``+observationsMetadata`` has been included.

### Examples
```{code}
get_indicators_systems_code_instances("C00075H")
get_indicators_systems_code_instances(
  "C00075H",
  q='id EQ "INDICADORES_MUNICIPALES"'
)
```

## Get indicators system code instances code
This function returns metadata of an indicator set associated with a specific indicator system. An instance of an indicator is nothing more than a spatio-temporal query of an indicator when it is incorporated into a specific indicator system.

### Parameters 
- indicatorsystemcode (string) indicator system code
- indicatorinstancecode (string) indicator instance code

### Examples
```{code}
get_indicators_systems_code_instances_code(
  "C00075H",
  "21af0477-d63b-493b-ad02-4ab181547223"
)
```

## Get indicators system code instances code data
This function returns metadata of an indicator set associated with a specific indicator system. An instance of an indicator is nothing more than a spatio-temporal query of an indicator when it is incorporated into a specific indicator system.

### Paremeters
- indicatorsystemcode (string): Indicator system code
- indicatorinstancecode (string): Indicator instance code
- representation (string): Allows filtering the observations by their value.
- granularity (string): Allows to filter the observations through the granularities of the same.
- fields (string): Allows you to customize the response by excluding fields. The possible values are: ``-observationsMetadata``.

### Examples
```{code}
get_indicators_systems_code_instances_code_data(
  "C00075H",
  "21af0477-d63b-493b-ad02-4ab181547223"
)
```
